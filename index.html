<h1>How To Make A Pinhole Camera</h1>



<p>Modern photography has become like much of our food: conformist, ultra-processed and lacking in substance. Pinhole photography on the other hand, is a total rejection of all this. It can and will completely re-ignite passion and a sense of meaning into your photography, forcing us to let go of control, to slow down, and observe.</p>

<h3>How a Pinhole Camera Sees Reality</h3>


<p>Garry Winogrand famously said, "I Photograph to See What the World Looks Like Photographed." A pinhole camera is the ultimate window to see reality in a surprising way. The pinhole camera itself is a photographer. It does not show us the world as we see it. Instead, it provides a view that is seems from another dimension, a parallel universe just beyond the conscious. Pinhole images speak in a language that makes us ponder questions about our mortality, the immensity of space and time, the meanings of consciousness and existence.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of a Pinhole Image</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Near infinite depth-of-field:</strong> Because of the small apertures, everything from the smallest grain of sand to infinity will appear sharp. This is one of the most fascinating aspects of pinhole photography, and impossible to do with a lensed camera.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Extreme perspective and scale:</strong> Scale and distance become monumental, and you see a "worm's view" of the world. Most images will have a very wide angle view, without the barrel distortion from a lens.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Motion blur: </strong>Pinhole cameras require very long exposures due to the small aperture. This can in blur from moving objects, producing ghostly forms.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unpredictable aberrations: </strong>Flares, light leaks, distortions and unexplained phenomena are often present in pinhole images, especially when you use paper negatives and homemade cameras. This is one of the greatest features, and the reason these images can have such a profound layers of meaning and interpretation.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Strong vignetting: </strong>Light falloff at the edges of the image will be very pronounced, darkening the image the farther from the middle it is.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Constructing the Camera</h3>


<p>Pinhole cameras are nothing more than a light-proof chamber with a hole, and a way to capture the imprint of photons such as a film, photo paper or a digital sensor. They can be extremely simple or complex, cheap or expensive. They come in any shape, form or style that you want. Once you make one, you will be inspired to experiment with the many variables within your control. The purpose of this guide is to provide the essential steps in a simple and clear manner.</p>

<h3>The Tin Can Pinhole Camera With Paper Negative</h3>

<p>A tea, coffee, oatmeal or any other type of metal or cardboard cylinder container is by far the best way to begin. Not only that, tin can pinhole cameras with paper negatives are by far my favorite. They cost virtually nothing and are made with readily-available materials. They do not require a completely dark darkroom. The large paper negatives are easy to develop, scan and store. They truly embody the ethos of pinhole photography. The best reason I favor this type of camera however, is that they result in the most fascinating images, often due to the more “crude” construction. The vast majority of my favorite images have been made with the humble tin can pinhole camera with a paper negative.</p>

<h3>Materials You Need</h3>

<ol>
<li>Tin can: This can be any cylindrical container. Anything between 2.5 and 5 inches in diameter and a maximum height of 9 inches is ideal. Metal is preferred, but cardboard does the job as well.</li>
<li>Cereal Box</li>
<li>Aluminum soda Can</li>
<li>Black spray</li>
<li>Electrical Tape</li>
<li>Utility knife</li>
<li>#12 sewing needle</li>
<li>1000 & 600 grit sandpaper</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Super glue</li>
</ol>

<h3>Building The Camera</h3>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Using a utility knife, cut a hole about half-inch wide in the center of the container. This will be where the camera sees.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Paint the interior with the black spray paint and allow to dry. This is to minimize any internal reflections.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Cut a square piece of the soda can wall and round off the corners.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Using the #12 sewing needle, create the pinhole. The important part is to do it slowly so the resulting hole is as round as possible. Poke the needle a bit without going through completely, and use the sandpaper to sand down the bump until it feels smooth. Proceed as many times as needed until the needle goes completely through.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Use black electrical tape to adhere the pinhole to the outside of the camera.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> To make the shutter, cut a square piece of the cereal box cardboard around 2x2 inches. Use a smaller piece of cardboard and fold it and glue it to form a tab. This will be where you grab the shutter to move it in and out of position.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> Cut 2 pieces or cardboard 1 inch wide and a length that is ¾ the outside diameter of your camera. Place them horizontally over the top and bottom of the shutter, and tape them lengthwise along the top and with more tape at the ends. These pieces will now serve as “rails” for the shutter to move and cover/uncover the pinhole. Test the movement so it’s smooth but not too smooth. The shutter should remain in place. </p>

<p>Now that everything is in place, it's time to make an exposure!</p>
