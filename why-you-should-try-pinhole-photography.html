<h1>Why You Should Try Pinhole Photography</h1>


<p>You might feel modern photography is not fulfilling. The diarrhea of artificial intelligence, algorithms and social media have made photographs like much of our food: conformist, ultra-processed and lacking in substance. Discussions in photography websites center around gear worship and consumerism. Our digital files will be lost and forgotten in the cloud or drives, leaving us with no artifacts to leave behind. Our tools are owned by tech and software companies.</p> 

<p>Pinhole photography on the other hand, is a total rejection of all this. It can and will completely re-ignite passion and a sense of meaning into your photography.</p>

<h3>How a Pinhole Camera Sees Reality</h3>


<p>Garry Winogrand famously said, "I Photograph to See What the World Looks Like Photographed." A pinhole camera is the ultimate window to see reality in a surprising way. The pinhole camera itself is a photographer. It does not show us the world as we see it. Instead, it provides a view that is seems from another dimension, a parallel universe just beyond the conscious. Pinhole images speak in a language that makes us ponder questions about our mortality, the immensity of space and time, the meanings of consciousness and existence.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of a Pinhole Image</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Near infinite depth-of-field.</strong> Because of the small apertures, everything from the smallest grain of sand to infinity will appear sharp. This is one of the most fascinating aspects of pinhole photography, and impossible to do with a lensed camera.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Extreme perspective and scale.</strong> Scale and distance become monumental, and you see a "worm's view" of the world. Most images will have a very wide angle view, without the barrel distortion from a lens.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Motion blur. </strong>Pinhole cameras require very long exposures due to the small aperture. This can in blur from moving objects, producing ghostly forms.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Unpredictable aberrations. </strong>Flares, light leaks, distortions and unexplained phenomena are often present in pinhole images, especially when you use paper negatives and homemade cameras. This is one of the greatest features, and the reason these images can have such a profound layers of meaning and interpretation.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Strong vignetting. </strong>Light falloff at the edges of the image will be very pronounced, darkening the image the farther from the middle it is.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Learn to Let Go</h3>

<p>Every image taken with a pinhole camera is a surprise.</p>

<h3>Process Matters As Much As The Result</h3>

<p>Pinhole photography forces us to slow down, observe, see. The neurosis of instant gratification and distraction from digital cameras is gone.
