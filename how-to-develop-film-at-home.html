	<h1>Develop Film At Home Without a Dark Room</h1>

<p>If you're smart enough to make Mac and Cheese, you can develop filmâ€” you don't even need a dark room. The materials are cheap and the process is fun. You will learn a lot and save money in the process. So don't be intimidated and let's get started.</p>

<h3>Materials You Will Need</h3>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.freestylephoto.com/322730-Arista-Changing-Bag-27-in.-x-30-in.">Changing bag.</a> This a simple light-proof bag with holes to insert your arms, and it allows you to load and unload film instead of using a darkroom.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.freestylephoto.com/5041-Arista-Premium-Double-Reel-Developing-Tank-with-Two-Reels">Tank and reels.</a> This is a small light-proof container that has a hole for pouring the chemicals.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.freestylephoto.com/1641-Arista-Liquid-Film-Developer-12-oz.-(Makes-1-Gallon)">Arista liquid developer.</a> I use Arista chemistry because it's simple, proven, and affordable.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.freestylephoto.com/11912-Arista-Indicator-Stop-Bath-12-oz.-(Makes-3-Gallons)">Arista stop bath</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.freestylephoto.com/6200-Arista-Premium-Odorless-Liquid-Fixer-32-oz.">Arista odorless fixer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.freestylephoto.com/173100-Arista-Graduated-Cylinder-1000-ml">Graduated cylinder</a> or pitcher to measure chemicals. Get a 1000ml and a smaller one, perhaps 100ml for smaller amounts.</li>
<li>Clothespins to hang your prints.</li>
<li>Stopwatch</li>
<li>Thermometer</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, you will need a space to do this. A kitchen or bathroom is a good place because you have access to running water.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Loading your film into the development tank</h3>

<p>This is the step where you remove the exposed film from the canister or spool and feed it into the spiral so you can develop it. Since this is done in the changing bag, you will do this by feel only. At first it will be strange, but after a couple of rolls you will become quick. Some opt to sacrifice a roll of film to practice, but I recommend just jumping into it with the confidence you do it. Remember, there's no rush.</p>
